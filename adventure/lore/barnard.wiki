== Backstory ==

Barnard fell on the earth ages ago. His ship exploded in the atmosphere, and he passed out for a lot of time. Long enough to not know where the core of his spaceship ended up.

However, Barnard is not very keen on leaving if he can control the world. And finding the core would be enough. He hoped that rich people would have been intrigued by the core, so he searches old mansions looking for them, but so far, no luck. He decided that instead of being a simple burglar, he should make money from it, to be above the law.

He tends to not choose violence when possible, until he finds where the Core is. After that, all bets are off. However, he will delay going until absolutely necessary, or until the path is clear.
