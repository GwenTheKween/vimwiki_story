== Information on warlock persecution ==

There used to be a time when being a warlock was fine, people thought it was just a wizard with a different style.
about like 20 or so years ago, Edward Verstec started to work out that the magic actually had a different source, and at that point the witch hunt truly began.

Things were really heated for quite a while, but then the civil war started and with the big requirements for adventurers, the King made a rule to calm things down a little, and things calmed down a lot
The south is definitely the worst part to just be a warlock. Given what the players saw, it is liketly there is a group of people in the south part of the country that is fear mongering to get the witch hunt going again.
