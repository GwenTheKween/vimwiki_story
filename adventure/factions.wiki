== Church of the Second Coming ==

In Rio do sul there are a group of crazos worshiping the new god. They believe that a new god is upon us and the correct way to live this new order is to live positively like the sleepy ones. If you sinned in your past life you'll be awakened to test your character, and by choosing to live happily along the sleepyones, you prove your devotion, going back to sleep

They wish to be put back to sleep, but don't understand what is going on, so every once in a while they'll see a former devout back to being mesmerized and will cheer for it.

=== Commandments ===

1. You shall not remove people from heaven, nor shall you harm them;
2. You shall use your skills to serve those who have already been saved;
3. You shall use all extra time in self reflection and prayer, to attone for your sins;
4. Once re-accepted into heaven, you shall not leave once more;
5. You shall not interact with banished individuals

  Egon was never caught in the mesmerizing, due to being hidden so quietly at home. He saw the mesmerized people being hurt and decided to help. From talking to others, he figured it was paradise and created the whole religion. Nowadays he is so blissful in his service, even aliens themselves think he is mesmerized.  
  Egon believes that he was left awake as the martir and the sheperd, here to guide souls back to heaven and to care for the saved ones.

  Marcelo was accidentally awakened by Egon, because it triggered one of his traumas (SA). However, he doesn't realize this trauma, and fully buys into the religion, thinking that he was awakened.  
  He had a relationship with Roberto, Aline's son, and feels guilty that he wanted Roberto to be awakened, seeing as this would take Roberto away from heaven.
