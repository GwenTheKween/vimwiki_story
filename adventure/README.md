= Recovering the Croft Estate =

A sandbox campaign for D&D 5e, designed to get my wife into TTRPGs.

This campaign was greatly inspired by the game Darkest Dungeon in general idea and tone, and the details by the campaign Dungeons of Drakkenheim - by the Dungeon Dudes.

Pitch for a Game Master: Long ago, Cornelious Croft messed with things he didn't know enough about. This snowballed into needing to leave his castle behind, and now, several generations later, Lara Croft is back to reclaim the castle for her name. This is a sandbox campaign intended for 2 or 3 players (playable with 1 player and a DMPC) set in some island ruins, dealing with misterious magic.

Pitch for the players: Lara Croft - one of the players - found documents for the old Estate. After much research, she discovered the island where it is hidden, and wants to make it her home once again. Cornelious, the last croft to ever live there, said that "I should never have brought that cursed from the mainland. It was foolish of me to think I could control it, and once it became apparent that it had a mind of its own, it was too late. All we could do was flee the island and hope the water would contain it". Lara is open for some help, as Cornelious had a weird obsession with lizards, but it couldn't be worse than a big gecko, could it?
