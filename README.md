# vimwiki story
Personal repository for my own stories, mostly for TTRPGs

To avoid things interacting accidentally, each story has it's own branch. I have 2 branches already:

# Khean 

My base setting for fantasy TTRPGs. This world was created wholy by hand, down to the tectonic plates. It was my first world custom built, so it is probably garbage. If you are a player, DO NOT LOOK AT ANYTHING BUT THE LORE FOLDER

# The Facility

My general setting for Call of Cthulhu, based on the real world and some Cthulean and the SCP foundation. if you are a player DO NOT LOOK AT ANYTHING.
