== Deck Method ==

In game, you can use a deck of cards to represent the maze, instead of having the maze pre-drawn. Alternatively, you can use the deck method before the session and draw what happens.

The way cards will represent the maze is following rules, which is what the prep will define. Some example rules could be as follows:
* Cards with a drawing will have information for the players
* Aces will have monsters
* diamonds have a 2-intersection
* odd-numbered spades have a 3-way intersection
* clovers are the end of a path - odds, dead ends, evens, a cicle
* Other cards have nothing special happening

Cicles should be used only in advance, when you can redraw things to make sense for the players. One card, or the last of a type of rule, should be deemed the exit of the maze.
