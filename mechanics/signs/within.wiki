= Pull from Within =
[[overview.wiki|back to overview]]

The elemental pull felt from Within defines much of a person's personality. It informs the main strenghs and points of improvement for the person.

Because of the cyclic nature of the pulls, the Pull interacts with the 2 other pulls by strengthening one and weakening another.

The pull from within strengthens the [[others.wiki|Pull from Others]], because one tends to assume similar motives for others as one would have.

Conversely, this pull weakens the [[self.wiki|Pull unto Other]], as it works as a secondary motive for interactions.

=== Behind the curtain ===

The examples given here, however, are how one person would act if they did no introspection at all, which may be too much for a fun RPG table. Apply the strenghs and weaknesses with care to make an interesting character to play and to play _with_.
