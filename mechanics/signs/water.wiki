Water pulls feel slow, gentle, and calming. This pull makes people often be quite connected to emotions, patiently understanding their own and others', and eventually directing those according to their desires.

This pull is famous as a background schemer, patiently waiting for his plot come true. One of the origin of the saying: Slow and steady wins the war.

* The patience that comes from this pull means people are rarely caught unprepared by their own actions.
* Understanding emotion usually means people have great intuition, being able to rely on gut instincts quite often.

=== Weaknesses ===
