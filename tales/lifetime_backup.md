Notes to self:
This story is about being sold a lifetime backup for your brain after death, but computer upgrades aren't covered, so your head starts to react slower and slower until by the time you process an input it is no longer relevant.

# extend your life backup warrant

"lifetime license" what a big fucking lie. The marketing did do their research, because *technically* yes I can use the brainckup for however long I want.

Too bad support for this damn thing expired 15 years ago. They decided to "pivot their strategy into a more reliable model" or, as a normal person would say, find a way to extort money forever. You think I want to spend the rest of my digital eternity paying even more bills?

Of course, the final result for me is that I'm running in a compatibility program inside an emulated older version of the CPU and even the bare metal is struggling. Every second takes about an actual minute, I literally can't keep up with the world anymore.
