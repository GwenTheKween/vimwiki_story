# The Canyon

### By Guinevere Larsen

It is incredible just how much you get used to things. I grew up in a canyon, so I'm used to nearly 200 m tall sheer rock walls enveloping me, to a point where they barely register.

It doesn't stop me from enjoying them, though. I walked up and down the canyon system so much that I bet I could navigate them with my eyes closed. Which just made it all the more surprising when I saw a new one in the plains. Now, I don't know how canyons are formed, but I think they're supposed to happen over centuries, not days, and this only made me want to enter it more.

Unlike the other canyons around, though, I couldn't just walk down through it. None of the edges of the canyon have the gentle slide into the bottom that I'm used to, but that wouldn't stop me. I had some experience with rappelling that would really come in handy.

While looking for a good place to setup my ropes, I notice, I think for the first time, the symmetry in the canyons. Its usually one of those small things, how the wall on the left goes in everytime the right wall goes out. The reason it was more apparent this time was because the changes were more apparent. While most canyons look to be a giant tracing their finger through the earth, this one looked more like giant hands pulled the earth apart, leaving jagged teeth.

Even more curious now, I pick a place in the innermost part of the wall, so I can latch it to both sides for extra safety. As soon as I start the descent, I am very tahnkful for that, because the jagged bits seem to only go about 5 meters down, then they gave way to a smoother wall, something much closer to what I was used to seeing. Climbing back up will be a pain, but that is a problem for future me, I have to see how such a weird canyon.

My first hop on the smooth wall startles me, however. It makes a wet splat that echoes until what seems to be the guts of the earth. The echo displaces some loose dirt at ground level, which I feel falling in my face. I stop on before the second hop to turn on the lamp on my helmet, so I can take a better look at what I'm seeing. And it was the best decision I made this far.

The walls of the cave start glittering, as the gentle water that is probably responsible for all this daze me with reflections. Looking down, I can see the glittering going as far as my light reaches, and the very center of the cave seems to have some sort of crystal that concentrates the light and - due to my slight swaying in the rope, slightly pulsates in the darkness of the bottom. This amazing visage is only stopped when the loose earth that keeps falling.

My last lucky moment happened when I look up to see how fast I'm dashing to the bottom and realize that I'm not moving as fast as I'm approaching that crystal. I have one last moment of panic before I notice that the echo of my steps weren't displacing the dirt. What actually happened was that the wall that I've been rappeling down was slowly but surely approacing the other wall, closing the mouth that was finally fed.
