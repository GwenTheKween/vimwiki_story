Some backstory about the characters:

## Sarah
She/her

### Part 1

"Daddy! Daddy! Do a magic trick" Rushed the words through the door, barely keeping up with Sarah. Edward looked up from the crystal he'd been studying into the doors, first to his daughter, then his wife with a defeated face.

"Hey hey, slow down honey. You know daddy is working, right?" Edward asked before grunting as he raised Sarah to his lap. "Yes, but mommy said it was time for lunch, and you could make a magic trick for me!" exclaimed Sarah back. "Lunch time? But I just barely started" Edward's eyes darted to the sun who wouldn't lie about the time to give him a break.

"Ok, sweetie. What magic do you want to see?". Sarah produced a gold piece and said "make this coin disappear!". Edward glanced at the coin before staring silently at the crow on his shoulder for a second. He put Sarah down with another grunt and started to speak with a different cadence.

"A coin disappear? Oh sweet child, how can disappearing something so small be impressive?" Edward spoke, with the tone halfway between a wanna-be magician and a university lecturer, "how about I try something truly amazing? Oh I know! I'll make my little friend disappear" he raised his left hand to his shoulder, which the crow took as a cue to move.

"No! Don't hurt Easter, daddy, please!" Cried Sarah. "Worry not, my dear. He will be quite safe, you will just not perceive him" as he spoke, his right hand clumsily moved from left to right in a failed attempt at sleigh of hand, before one final flourish accompanied the last word and the crow finally vanished. Edward picked the gold piece from a giggling Sarah and continued, "There is a great difference between how things truly are, and how we see them", the coin rolled from finger to finger, then jumped from one hand to another. With one final flick of the finger, the coin flew up high as the voice crescendoed, "In fact when you learn that what you see is very deceiving", it staggered in the air for just a second before vanishing in a small gust of air towards Sarahs shoulders, "then, you can truly understand the world" finished Edward softly, as the crow reappeared on Sarah's shoulder, holding a gold piece in its beak

Sarah exclaimed wonderful things in pure child joy as she attempted to pet the crow and rushed behind him. "Go wash yourself now. It is lunch time and daddy still has much to research." Edward gently whisked Sarah away. With tensed up shoulders, he collected his notes as quickly as possible while examining the outside, and only after ensuring that no one has seen that, did he relax and lock his notes in the cabinet. They are safe for now, but he really shouldn't do this at home

### Part 2

"Why can't you, dad?" Sarah continued interrogating. "Just yesterday, on my 12th birthday, you made some magic, and now you're saying you can't teach me?"

"I can't, Sarah", said Edward, "the townspeople don't like this magic, and I don't want you to feel that. It was alright some 4 years ago, but something happened."

"News flash, dad, people already hate me. No one talks to me, teachers look down when I ask questions" tears welled up in Sarah's eyes as she pushed one of the boxes on Edward's extremely messy table. A cracking sound pierced the air as a multitude of crystals spread through the floor, all relatively oval but in a variety of colors. "If people hate me for something you are doing, why can't I at least learn to do it to and get something from it?"

"It's not that simple, baby girl" Edward sighed and doubled over, starting to collect the gems. "You'll understand when you're older, but trust me. I'm doing you a service. Trust your dad, please."

"You don't..." Sarah's rebuttal was cut short by a knock in the door. She looked at the father who froze for a few seconds and started to collect everything even faster, pretending like he hadn't heard it. When the knock came a second time, Sarah grumpily mumbled "fine, I'll get the door"

As Sarah left the room, she heard the box being rested in the table. Brushing away the tears, the kid yelled "I'm coming" so the visitors wouldn't knock again. Without removing the chain from the door, she opened a bit. "Who's there?"

"Hi little girl!" Came a voice with a hollow warmth to it. "It's daddy home?" Through clenched teeth, Sarah mumbled some affirmative response. "Can we come in? There is some important matters we have to talk to him" there was a clang as the gauntlet of the visitor pressed against the door.

"Uhm... I think it's better if I call him. DAD!" The last word was aimed at the stairs behind Sarah. The chain started rattling as the voice outside continued insisting on coming in. "Dad?" This was closer to a cry for help, and Sarah rushed away from the door.

Before she made it to the stairway, there was an explosion behind. Unable to stop herself, she turned to see a fully armored knight brandishing the mace that was used to break the only thing holding them back. Quick militaristic commands were issued by the voice that was trying to sound war just a minute ago. Each of his co-conspirators moved to each side of the entrance hall, as he knelt in front of Sarah.

"You know, your father did some very bad things." He shoved his fingers through the rose red cheeks of the recently crying child. "I'm sure your mom can take better care of you if she isn't scared of what your father might do. That's why we're here. It's too protect your family"

His cronies came back with negative responses, and pretending to care, he commanded the child to move aside. Unable to resist, Sarah left the stairwell and tried to burn a hole in the back of the head of the that man with her eyes. The image of the lizard with a mouth sewn shut that was stamped on the visitor's cloak would be forever stamped in her mind.

A gasp came from the door, as Mom came from the groceries run, and Sarah asked "mom, what did you do?"

"what?" A look of utter confusion crossed the mother's face. "Baby what are you talking about? What happened?"

"Some men came saying you were scared of what dad could do. Did you say something to someone?" The little girl was staying to cry again. Dropping the bags, the mother rushed in and hugged her daughter, husking and calming her down.

"Listen, I am not scared of your father and never have been. I don't know who said this to you, but they were lying through their teeth". The hardness of the words and tone were not directed at Sarah, and while not comforting, they at least felt like something she could cling to.

Another minute of the mother comforting her daughter passed before the stomps from the upper floor. Mom got up in a protective stance, as the commanding voice inquired from above "Ma'am, where is your husband? We heard that he had been dealing with dangerous magic, and we're here to ensure that everyone is safe"

"You've clearly already searched the house." Said mom, in a voice just as cold as the upstairs question. "I was not at home, you literally know better than me that he is not here."

"radnamoC" time seemed to move backwards as the paladin uttered the incantation, then all at once a whole word exploded "CONFESS where is your husband hiding" the shock wave accompanying the first word almost knocked Sarah off her feet.

Mom kept the stern face and simply said "I do not know. Now leave before I call the real law enforcement". Her resolve clearly shook the armored man, who signaled his cronies to leave. Once they were alone again, mom turned to Sarah and said "your dad knew this could happen. I just hope whatever he planned can save his life". She sighed, no longer needing to steel herself so much. "I'm going to see if there is anything left. Do you want to stay here?" At the mention of starting behind, the crying little girl hugged her mom even harder and shook her head.

They climbed the stairs carefully, and Sarah screamed at the mess that greeted them. The overturned table and chairs were almost expected. What Sarah couldn't believe was that all the boxes were nowhere to be seen.

### Part 3

"Of course they would come for me, next" Sarah's pacing slowed down as she began yelling to the walls. "I never even did anything, I am just the daughter of my father! AAAA" Sarah punched the wall, then yelled again at the pain.

Nursing her hand, she continued, "thanks, dad, 'you're going to thank me some day', fat load of help it did, so that when Ralf went ape shit on ME I couldn't defend myself." The tears won over her self control yet again. "Stupid witch hunt, dad never even do anything and mom burn every piece of paper with his hand writing that she ever found, why would they lock ME here?"

She had heard the rumors that there were actually more people studying witchcraft in the town, you couldn't escape those. Between the teenagers who thought it was the coolest and would apparently get together right here in the lighthouse, to the stupid hatemongers who said that the people who studied it were devoted to Bealod√¶d and his devils. She rolled her eyes when she remembered those accusations, "as if dad would ever do that", she thought. But it doesn't matter if he did or not, she was stuck here.

Sarah looked around a bit "actually, why here?". Curiosity finally got the better of her, and she took in the prison walls around her. The rough compacted dirt wouldn't make for a comfortable bed, but at least being in the basement meant that she had a roof over her head, which was better than being locked at the top where everyone said they locked the witches and warlocks. "It will make for a much worse bathroom", thought Sarah, deciding to think about something else while she could.

The walls looked barren at first, just really badly scratched... but the more she looked, the more it felt like there was some hidden pattern. In fact, they didn't look natural at all, looked like someone had carved it with a knife. And it wasn't a recent thing either, judging by how smooth the carving was. Now if Sarah could only remember why they felt so familiar...

As the woman stared, the hidden pattern felt closer, but never quite in reach. her fingers ran through the endless bifurcations of the carving, a fractal pattern that mesmerized the great warlock's daughter. Some time later, it could have been hours or days, the prisoner heard some shuffling by the door. When she finally managed to get enough self control, she looked towards it for long enough to notice that there was a food tray and a bucket by the door. A thin pir√£o and some water is what passed for her "meal", and she finally realized how hungry she was. She devoured the food, bland as it was, and with nothing better to do, went back to tracing the walls. That's when it hit her.

It makes sense that she couldn't remember, it was 10 years ago, and she never understood them anyway. But she could see the same patterns in her father's writing before he disappeared. Maybe, just maybe, she could get the knowledge that his father's tried to hide from her.

The routine shaped itself almost immediately. whenever the food wasn't there, and she didn't need to sleep, she focused on the writing. Some times she could feel a tingling on her hands, or could almost feel a gust of some non-existent wind, others things felt just an impossible as when she was 11. On one of those days, as she tracked over the weirdest of them, and the one that felt most jagged, Sarah pleaded once again for her father. "I know you were protecting me. I get it now. But it didn't work, so please, please", her voice faltered, "do something".

"CAW" came the cry of a crow. The surprise stopped the tears that started showing on Sarah's eyes again. "Where are you?" the room looked empty. "CAW" came another cry, "here WHERE?", and suddenly it appeared. A dark, large crow appeared at her feet, and jumped to her arm. "Who are you?", asked the prisoner to the bird that materialized in the locked cell, to which the crow just looked around. "Oh, don't have a name? Do you mind if I call you Pascal? You remind me of my father's friend", the bird hopped across her arm and nuzzled on her neck.

"Thank you. I feel less lonely already... Now back to this. Why cant I get more than a tingling?" Sarah's hand followed one of the simpler symbols, now more as muscle memory than actually seeing it. The studying witch felt the energy gathering at her fingertips, before dissipating once again. "Caw" chimed the crow at that. "What do you mean, 'release word'?", the crow replied with multiple caws, "You mean I'm supposed to finish with kselB?" as she finished pronouncing the word, the tingling that was almost disappearing her fingertips flared like never before and exploded from there to the wall, leaving a very small scorch mark, very close to the many others in there.

The surprise, more than any recoil, forced Sarah backwards, sitting her on the floor before she could really process what happened. She stared at her hands, completely unharmed. Her eyes went up to the crow, slowly flapping his wings and staying in place, then back to her fingers. "I can't believe it! I did it!! Thank you thank you thank you" the witchling jumped and tried to hug the crow, that dived away from her arms in fright.

"Hey wait", her mind was finally done processing what just happen, "do you happen to know this one?" She pointed at a section of the carvings that looked more like some form of rune than a fractal pattern. "CAW" was the reply, after a moment. "Oh I just speak it? How did you pronounce it..." Her voice stumbled on the unexpected amount of consonants, "ti≈ô√°Z", from the center of her vision exploded a shining powder that grabbed onto Pascal, making him shine dimly in the room. Sarah suddenly felt very tired, her arms felt too heavy to trace the fractals, and all she could do was try and not fall asleep. At this moment, a sound came from the door.

Sarah jumped, then realized she was so enthralled by her newfound powers that she must have not noticed it was time for dinner already. Looking around she saw the shining outline of her crow attempting to hide behind her. "It's ok", she said, "it's just dinner. No one is around". She looked back at the door and a face she hoped to never see again was at the other end of the room, flanked by 2 crossbowmen.

"Hello Sarah", said Ralf Zimmerman - the bastard responsible for getting her here in the first place. "I'm here to take you to the new cell. The place was finally opened in it. I'm sorry we had to put a despicable witch like you in such a nice place like this." You could almost hear the venom dripping from his words.

"What do you mean a place was opened?" Sarah couldn't think of anything else to say, as she tried to pretend the invisible glowing crow wasn't there, "did you get convinced that someone isn't a witch?"

"No one can hide their true selves, no no no." He smirked "the life sentence was not lifted, but they decided to... shorten it." His face went back to being serious, "now unless you want to follow in their footsteps, come along." The man turned to the exit and started to walk.

With no better way to protect herself, Sarah followed him, looking back at where she last saw the outline of Pascal, now thankfully no longer there. Her captor signaled the stairway up the lighthouse as she exited the basement, and not wanting to risk the crossbow bolts, she obeyed. Once at the top, Ralf opened the door and said "enjoy this new bedroom. It's going to last your lifetime" shoved her in and locked the door behind her.

The sun was blinding, after so long in the basement. It was right over her head and the only space that would offer some protection was occupied by the brazier full of the ashes that told of a time when this was more than a makeshift prison. The handrails that used to surround this open section have been removed, "for the prisoner's convenience", Sarah muttered.

"CAW" cried the invisible pascal in the witchling's mind. "Great! but... I'm exhausted. I can barely walk after that little experiment in the basement. Besides, if I just run away now, they'll come after me and lock me here again or worse, just outright kill me!" The bird flew to the lighthouse's brazier. it's usually twitchy movements got even more erratic, tracing yet another fractal movement tree. As Sarah traced after the bird's head, her arm moved so fast it seemed to have 2. once the pattern was finished, the crow cried and the witch answered "√©nletipalopeN", a secondary Sarah seemed to start stepping from where the real Sarah was, but as soon as the illusion fully stepped away, glass-like cracks covered its body, and the whole thing exploded into visual shards that didn't collect at the ground. Sarah felt dizzy, having a really hard time even focusing on Pascal's direction.

The bird looked with a tilted inquisitive face at Sarah.  "No, I don't have one of those! Dad wouldn't even let me do the smallest of tricks, let alone give me whatever a 'focus' is". The girl exploded yet another thing that was kept from her. Pascal looked down, opened its wings, and flapped them away, going invisible before leaving the lighthouse. "No, come back I'm sorry..." her voice faltered as the tears finally caught up to her once more. "Don't leave me alone too."

Through crying, noon gave way to dinner time. Dinner turned into sunset, which turned into late night. Sarah couldn't really tell how late, as even the moon decided the witchling didn't deserve company. Once she was finally dry of tears and even the dinner was removed without her even seeing it, Sarah just crumpled into her sleeping position.

She couldn't really tell if she slept or not, all she knew what that a muted flapping woke her up. Pascal landed on her, dropped something on the ground in front of her and nuzzled in her cheek. Sarah blinked a few times as the world came in focus again, and picked up the thing that pascal dropped. Sarah felt around the object, and felt a very sharp edge, a smooth hole, and what seemed like a beak. She raised the object against the village, hoping to use what little torch light came from it, and noticed it looks like a mask. Curiosity, once again, took hold and the witchling decided to see if the mask would fit her face. 

"Caw" encouraged Pascal. As soon as Sarah placed the mask on her head, it stuck. In a panic, she tried to rip it off her face, and to her surprise there was no resistance. Sarah looked again, but as far as she could see by starlight and distant torches, it was just plain ceramics. Donning the mask once more, the witch immediately felt the power starting at the mask and coursing through the rest of her body. Mimicking the same movements that she remembered Pascal making, Sarah uttered "√©nletipalopeN" and she felt the illusion linger a bit longer in her head, before stepping off, save for an invisible tether to the mask. A perfect replica of Sarah stood before her, repeating the same actions that she did throughout the day. Sarah turned to Pascal, "alright, let's test this gift from my father. et≈àuse≈ôP". 

Her feet were slowly engulfed by a mist that appeared from nowhere, and before she could react, Sarah found herself in front of her mother's house. Thinking quickly, she picked some gravel, and spelled out "I'm fine" in the entrance mat, before leaving the city for good. 

Unseen as she escaped the town, Sarah camped in the wilderness for a while, before moving to a different town, resupplying in both gold and food, and disappearing again. Weeks turned to months, turned to years. Until one day, when she finally stopped to read the notice poster she saw so frequently in recent times. A poster from the king, that read "Attention adventurers! Report instantly to Cynesel for cataloguing and training. All non-enlisted Adventurers will be branded enemies of the state."

Sarah sighed and looked at pascal, who cawed to confirm that yes, she is an Adventurer and yes, this is a bad idea. "It's better than being in prison again. Maybe I can hide the type of magic, or at least, the king can protect me from the witch hunt." Pascal cawed in protest, but Sarah turned to the capital city. It was time to live in a single place again.

## Allex
they/them

### Part 1

"Allex, is time for bed, dear!"

"But moooom! I'm to energetic I can't sleep", Allex whined

"I'll tell you a bedtime story if you do" Mary said, with the knowing smile of a mother.

"Ok", Allex faked giving in, "make it a good one"

"A long time ago, Khean was nothing more than a big ball of water floating in nothingness" Mary started

"Yaaaay! I live this one!" Allex jump back to their feet in their bed.

"Nuh uh. You have to behave, or I will stop with the stories." As Allex lay back down in the bed, Mary continued her story, "around it, Solus and Lluma floated freely...

They could stay forever in this dance, never approaching, both following the other in the sky. But forever is a long time, and just like us humans, the Gods grew bored.

Lluma was the first to try something different, and with her powers, she pulled the water to herself, then threw it towards Solus. And as she did that, he decided to join and create solid rocks that ..."

"SPLAAAAASH" exclaimed Allex, having forgotten their promise to behave. Mary chuckled, "yes, waves started hitting the ground. So big that they could wash away the whole capital of the realm!

But as they splashed, some of the water would fly into the skies, where it could never come back. If you look up, you can still see the water drops perfectly still in the night sky" and Allex's eyes glinted with the pure wonder that only 5 year olds have.

"After some time", Mary continued, "Lluma grew scared of how much water was trapped in the sky, so she stopped pulling the water and, noticing that some of the rocks that Solus created were above the water level, she decided to come down to the ground. All that there was was bare dirt, the placid water of a sea with no tides, and the gistening of stars in the sky.

That was, until Solus came around, and he shone so brightly that he was hide the stars behind himself. The third or fourth time that he did that, she signaled him to come down and meet her. No one knows what they told each other, all that we know is that every living thing spawned from their love"

"Ewwww. Don't talk about those gross things mom!". It was Mary's time to chuckle, "Allex, darling, love is not gross. True love is what moves people. Besides, I was talking about them creating plants as gifts to each other. But yes, they did have 6 children in those days. One of them being our God, Leode."

"Ah, mom, please! Just a little more", pleaded Allex.

"No. You have a long enough day tomorrow with dad at the boat. Sleep now". Mary kissed her child good night, blew out the candle, and left Allex for their prophetic dreams.

### Part 2

"Mom! Can you continue the story now?" Allex had gotten to bed earlier than usual.

"Sure thing, sweetie" Mary smiled at the prospect of a quieter might. Allex was a lovely child, but they could also be a handful. It would be nice to have a night to rest. "Where did we stop yesterday?"

"Solus and Lluma have just created plants and had children!" Allex volunteered, excited to continue the story.

"Ah yes, I remember". The mother paused for a moment to find the details of the story she hadn't been told since school was over. "Yes, they had 6 children. One on each of the great landmasses of this world. Solus allowed each of his children to create one species of creature, and decided that it would be enough to make the continents lively.

Now, most continents are very far from each other, so we don't actually know most of the gods. The one we do know is called Leode, the one who blesses us." Mary's face seemed hopeful as she looked up to the sky, then her face went serious again. "And we know about Bealod√¶d. The disobeying child.

Bealod√¶d rushed to create their own species, but because they didn't spend enough time in designing them, all those creatures could do was roam the continent, fight and eat. They were not smart enough to make any type of civilization. Leode, on the other hand, took his time, designing humans with twigs to make out skeleton, rocks and stones to make our muscles, and mud to shape us in his own image. You know", Mary gave her child a mischievous smile "this is why us humans can eat almost anything." Allex frowned on hearing that, "just because I can eat the greens doesn't mean I want to." Their voice was as bitter as the vegetables he left during dinner.

"I'm sure one day you'll learn to love all the gifts that Leode gave you. Being an Adventurer, eating greens, and everything else." Allex frown deepened "if being an Adventurer is such a gift, why won't anyone play with me?"

Mary sighed. "Sometimes, people have difficulty dealing with those that are different. But once they get to know you, things will change." She looked longingly at the horizon "besides", her voice became more cheery, "I'm sure a gifted Adventurer like yourself will surely make it big in the capital, and leave these superstitious people."

"but I like their stories" protested Allex. "The one about the sea that fishes people is really funny." The child seemed to be getting more agitated at that topic, Mary had to stop that before it got out of hand. "Well, maybe I can tell you that one next time, but tonight, we should go back to the betrayal of Bealod√¶d.

As I was saying, where Leode and the gods with lost names succeeded, Bealod√¶d failed and their first creation was never able to make a civilization. Solus, showing his great piety, allowed his child to create more, with one condition: none of them was to create civilizations to rival their siblings, but instead should augment them.

Bealod√¶d then created our blessed elephants, the sheep and all other animals we know. But the god eventually tired", Mom's tone went from cheerful to somber in this quick sentence, "of their creations being controlled by someone other than Bealod√¶d themselves. They decided that payback was due. And that was when bears, and tigers and other creatures that hunt us." Allex hid their face under the blankets at this.

"And this is where you come in, sweetheart." Mom ran her fingers through the child's hair. "Leode decided to protect his children by sending Adventurers as blessed children of regular people. That's why you are stronger, faster and more resilient than anyone else in this village."

"What about the green knight?" Asked Allex. For the first time, mom gave a truly puzzled look. "You know, the knight who has visited my sleep last night. He said he was coming today." Mary hesitated for a second, and started to ask for more.

As she opened her mouth, though, a shriek made pierced the calm and quiet of the child's room. Mary's eyes widened, and she heard herself saying "stay here", as she darted outside. Allex bunkered down under their blanket, and prayed for Leode to send his knight to save the village

As they stopped for breath, Allex managed to hear the muffled voices of Mary and someone else who seemed very upset. It was too loud outside, and the other person was speaking too fast, all Allex could pick up was "army", "invasion" and "run". Not that most of those words really meant anything to them, all they were were story words, things that happened to other people.

What did mean something was the scream that came soon after. Their mom had never produced a sound like that, and Allex began to cry as they continued the prayer. The scream was eventually replaced by running footsteps that the little kid hoped came from his mom.

More screams followed, and then something even more unexpected. The protection blanket was pierced by a warm light. Curious, the little 7 year old couldn't hold themselves and peeked out to find the neighboring house ablaze. The flames mesmerized the kid until the warmth was too much to handle. The last thing Allex remembers seeing out of the window was the totally white face of a skeleton carrying a torch towards their safe haven.

Faster than they would have thought possible, Allex ran to the door. The simple thatched roof of the house exploded in flames instantly, and as the 7 year old started kicking at the door, the oppressive heat engulfed them. Small splinters flew under the debris that was stopping the door, remains of another neighbor's house that stopped burning before they fell. Seeing that the kicks were useless, the Adventurer decided to run into the door instead.

Small cracks started to form, as their shoulder repeatedly slammed against the wooden prison wall once, twice, three times. Then Allex stopped to breathe the grey air. It was getting darker by the second. As they prepared for another go, a low rumbling - different to the roar that surrounded him - caught him by surprise coming from the outside. Without energy left to think, the little kid threw all his strength at the door and they felt the floor letting their little body go, that may have been from smoke inhalation or may had had to do with the sound of splintering wood, they couldn't tell.

The next hazy images are but disconnected memories of a green figure standing over Allex, then standing under him as the ground moved closer and further, closer and further. Finally, the jerky movement turned into a smooth up and down motion of waves, as the green knight pushed the boat Allex was laying down in. The knight looked for some time, ensuring the push was enough for the boat to be taken by the ocean currents, before turning back to the burning village.

### Part 3

Days. It had been days on the boat. Nothing but encircling birds, unrelenting sun, and an unrelenting thirst. Until Allex could handle it anymore, they raised up from where they were lay down, leaned over the edge of the boat and reached of the water. Then, the sound of something flying through the air hit them a split second before an actual steel thing pierced their skin and pulled them overboard.

They woke up right before touching the water, as usual. Allex breathed in deeply and uttered a quick prayer to Lluma once again. They understood why the terrible childhood dreams happened again, now that they were back in the sea, but they were no longer a child, they were old enough to understand the message the first time. Besides, if there is something that needs repeating, it's the one that sent Allex down this wild goose chase.

It felt almost more like a memory than a dream, but there is no way it could actually be a memory. Allex tried their best to remember the dream as best they could. They were back to Wodfics as it was being burned. The green knight that followed Allex's dreams was carrying them away from the fire, setting the kid on the little canoe and telling him "When you remember thisss, it is time. I will protect you in your journey, but I need you to come back in time. Promissse to follow my path, and together we will be able to sssave all living creaturesss."

The impromptu sailor retraced their steps. There was only one option, really. Who else would have used the ocean to protect the innocent child? Who would have said "living creatures", explicitly removing undead creatures? And most importantly, who would have sent their powerful warrior to stop the undead menace? It must have been Lluma. Must have been.

So back Allex went. Following the moon in the sky, they undid their unconscious childhood steps, and sailed back towards Wodfics in a boat kindly provided by the Bergensohnnen. Used to sailing these seas, those short folk had developed a boat with an enclosed cabin, and Allex learned well enough from the dreams that the cabin was not to be left, no matter how uncomfortable it was to walk on their knees everywhere.

Two weeks after starting the voyage, the port was finally in sight. The little town never had a lighthouse, no one who went far in that see ever came back, to the best of Allex's knowledge. That means that nothing prepared the grown adult to see ashes and burnt remains of the village they kept alive in their heart. Only at this moment did they notice how big the ship actually was. There is no way to make it fir the port. All that it could handle were small 3-4 person canoes at best, not the 5 meter long pedal boats that the Bergensohnnen used. Nevermind the fact that Allex had not experience manipulating such a ship in tight spaces.

Dropping anchor, Allex took one last look at the vessel that kept them safe, and jumped ship, swimming the last kilometer to shore. Once at shore, they were hit with the full force of the desolation. No house remained standing, no wall unburnt. Dripping salt water and saltier tears, Allex made the familiar path from the beach to their old home, passing by shattered bones, incredibly showing no signs of natural rot.

The last 2 decades were not kind to what remained of the burned out wooden remains of Allex's childhood home. The only way s to notice where the front door used to be were the smooth ending of a wall on one side, and the pile of rubble on the other, just barely pushed out of the way so that they could escape.

"Why?" cried Allex, "Why just me?" Allex finally broke down, bawling their eyes out at the base of what felt like their mother's grave.

"Becausss I can't be everyone at onssse" Came a reply. "That'sss where you come in." Allex sniffled, trying to stiff out the crying and turned aroud. A hooded figure had approached their back, and seemingly just dismounted from their horse.

"Are" They stumbled in their speech, "are you..."

"Who you came to meet, yesss", Allex was having a hard time placing the stranger's accent. Over 20 years without speaking a language does make things more difficult, after all.

"I'm sorry, but how..." Allex hesitated, looking for a way to not offend the figure before them "... how do I know that?"

"Fear not." the stranger lowered their cloak, revealing a helmet that fully covered their face. "I exsspect my championsss to question thingsss. There isss much evil in the world that can't be undone if one acceptsss the ssstoriesss unquestioningly." The helmet was also removed, revealing that the stranger was, in fact, the green knight from that fateful night. 

Allex dropped to their knees. "I sssee you ssstill remember me."

"My savior. Of course!" Standing in a praying position now, Allex couldn't hold themselves, "Are you an envoy of Lluma? Are you here to guide me to follow her commandments? Will we destroy the undead menace?"

"Calm, my champion." The stranger sounded very stoic, "I promissse you, all the quessstionsss will be anssswered. You will have your chance at revenge for the perpetrator of this tragedy, this much I guarantee."

"Is all I ask. I pledge I shall follow your guidance." Allex finally raised their eyes, just in time to see the stranger's left hand leaving their back with a Halberd, designed just how the Bergensohnnen that them to use.

"And I pledge that, for asss long asss you follow my inssstructionsss, I ssshall lend you my power. Rise, my Paladin."

"Where do we begin? Do you know where did the army here fled to?" Allex barely contained their emotions, a mixture between excitement at the task ahead and nostalgia at the reasoning.

"Thingsss are never thisss sssimple." resetting the helmet and hood, the figure turned back to their horse. With a single gracious jump, they climbed onto the horse and said "Your first is enlisting in the King's army. Wouldn't want you to be an outlaw, now would I?" and with a gentle kick, the horse jumped forwards, and disappeared into the depths of Ghestimbers, the forest that stopped the village from expanding inland.

Behind, all that was left was a poster which read "Attention adventurers! Report instantly to Cynesel for cataloguing and training. All non-enlisted Adventurers will be branded enemies of the state."

Allex turned south, towards the capital, and muttered to themselves, "Do not worry, soldier of Lluma, I will keep my promise". And began the days-long walk towards Cynesel

## Killian
He/him

### Part 1

"Atta boy, Killian!" Exclaimed Sergei as he was hit with the toy mallet. "But going for the knees makes you vulnerable to uppies HAAA!" The 7 year old laughed from the tickles and being raised over the father's head. He couldn't help but laugh along for a minute, before settling down into his serious tone.

"You are learning quickly, but you're forgetting your basics. Where is your hammer?" Killian scrambles to pick it up in shame, "your life will depend on it one day. Be sure to always have it at arms reach."

"Even when we're playing?" Killian asked, sheepishly. "Yes, even when we're playing. You are learning the things that will someday save your life. But that's enough seriousness for now, after all, the time for your field trip is approaching."

"Yes yes YES! I always wanted to see inside the guild" Killian couldn't hold his excitement. Sergei extended his hand, and Killian obediently placed the toy mallet in it. "See you later, dad!" Yelled the kid as he darted off towards School.

As Killian was approaching the school gates, a snickering voice greeted him "Are you ready to meet actually important people, Rowan?" Said Yorin. Killian tried to pretend to ignore, but the bully didn't buy it. "You know, the people actually doing something with the name you carry around, while all you do is play with rubber toys".

"Shut up" Killian replied, clearly trying to hold back his emotions. "What? I can't hear you while you cry" mocked Yorin. "I said shut up" the boy was clearly losing control of his temper.

"Why don't you make" before the bully managed to finish the sentence, Killian's fist was already in the boys stomach. Grasping for air, Yorin only managed an expression of shock as the supposed victim stepped forward, locked their foot behind his ankle and extended their arm. Next thing the bully noticed was the world spinning around as the ground slapped the back of his head. Only when the foot was already in his chest did he manage to cry for help.

"Young men, just what do you think you're doing?" Came the stern voice of Jessica, the teacher in charge of the kids for the day. "Both of you, drop it now. Gehilden, you better stop trying to fight everyone." "That's  not fair" cried Yorin "I didn't even do anything, he just decided to hit me!" Jessica's frown deepened "That's it, not only were you harassing a schoolmate, now you lied to a teacher. You are not going today, go to the principal" After sentencing him, the teacher turned to Killian.

"De Rowan, you are an Adventurer. You were sent to us by Leode to help humans, not yourself. You best keep your temper in check, if you want to make your family proud and, more importantly, be a part of the school trip. Do you understand me?". "Yes, miss. Sorry, miss" stammered Killian. "Great, so come with me to the classroom, let's wait for the rest of the kids." Without waiting, Jessica spun on her heels and moved towards the school building.

The wait was not long, no one wanted to be left behind after all. Neither was the walk towards the headquarters of the Rowan Guild, the famous giant slayers. The massive rose carved on the entrance doors stared at the whole class for a moment, until unseen hands opened them and a knight in shining armor welcomed the kids.

"A very good day, children! My name is Ulrich de Rowan and I will be guiding you through the guild today!" At those sweet words, Jessica finally relaxed her shoulders. She was free for the day. She waved goodbye to the kids as Ulrich continued "If you follow me through this next door, children, you'll see the museum."

A multitude of artifacts in pedestals interspersed with some paintings spread in front of the children, outlining a maze. Ulrich stopped at the first - an impressionist rendition of Rowan the First fighting the giant who started the war - and started recounting a story that Killian heard more times than the holy prayer.

The kid let his mind wander as the familiar descriptions of the strife washed over him. He noticed how the armor of the tour guide has no big dents in it, and how the decorative rose at the center of the breastplate had almost no scratches. Killian wondered if the knight was young or just that skilled. Then he noticed the belt. It had all 3 of the gemstones - meaning he was one of the highest ranking officers - and it looked absolutely ancient. Surely it must have been magically mended multiple times.

Killian was suddenly snapped back to reality when the group reached the best part of the tour, seeing the original artifacts that Rowan the First used in the epic fight. The real magical artifacts, that could keep themselves looking clean forever, unlike the replicas that compsed the standard uniform for soldiers of the guild. "And, since you have all been very well behaved, children" the voice of Ulrich cut through Killian's daydreams, "I can give you a small demonstration of the power of the artifacts, but please, don't tell anyone." The guide smirked. This white lie always impressed the visiting children.

Ulrich first removed his gauntlets, a perfect replica of the ones kept in the museum. "How about a demonstration of the Gauntlets of Lightning Control" He turned to a conveniently placed fighting dummy and the streaks of deep blue in the gloves started to glow. "I think this one is pretty self explanatory" Ulrich put all his might into slapping both hands at the head of the dummy and on contact, both of them discharged leaving deep burns from head to toes. All the children screamed of excitement at that.

"Next, the belt of giant's bane", said Ulrich, removing the second item from its pedestal. "I ask your forgiveness, as I can't really remove my belt, but I think" The man said as he put the belt around one shoulder as if taking it in tow "this should be enough. It will give me enough strength to defeat any giant that comes my way. If you would all step back", the children took several steps back. The sapphire buckle shined for the children, with a diamond on each side, exactly like the standard uniform of the highest ranked officers. Ulrich performed a fast flourish with his left hand, then punched the mannequin so strongly that the explosion would be heard for hundreds of feet, and the poor lifeless villain flew all the way out the door, about 15 ft away. The kids might have screamed some more, but Killian couldn't really tell with the ringing in his ear.

"Finally, the hammer of Thunderbolts" said the fighter, collecting the the maul that, by all means, should need 2 hands to wield, yet the handle was only big enough for one. "With this tool, we can finely control both". At a murmur of the guild member, once more lightning formed across the streaks of the gauntlets, but this time they focused at the tip of the hammer, that Ulrich - trying his best to hide the clumsiness of handling the unbalanced weapon - whipped at the defeated enemy, pulling it almost back to his feet.

Whatever lecture Ulrich tried to say for the next 10 minutes was lost in children screaming for more or gawking at how amazing the artifacts are. With the help of other 2 guild members, the tour guide finally managed to control the children, who reluctantly went back to the entrance. Killian, last in line as he daydreamed once more about wielding the legendary set of giant slaying gear, was stopped right before he left with the rest of the children. "Your father will accompany you home today, kid. I'll let your teacher know" said Ulrich, as he pointed to the backdoor where Sergei was waiting.

Killian followed his dad's beckoning, and when they were almost halfway home, he finally asked: "Are you going on another mission, dad?" "Aren't you a smart one?" Sergei chuckled, "Yes, we have reason to believe the giants are encroaching the territory of our city. We have to examine it. I'm just going to say goodbye to the rest of the family and the scout team will leave."

"Please, don't be long, dad."

### Part 2

"ATTEEEN-SHUN" at the command, the line of recruits went stiff and looked forward. It was still hard for Killian to look at Ulrich, the last man to see his father alive, but joining the guild was the most important thing he'd ever do. "You've done well so far, recruits. But don't think you're in yet. Just because some of you may carry my name around" Ulrich stared directly at Killian, "or may have done alright in the other tests, that you're done. This is the hard part. Everything until now was just because we didn't want anyone dying in our selection process"

Even though there were no murmuring, everyone felt the change in atmosphere at that. Small beads of sweat could be seen in the lines of wanna-be giant slayers.

"Now, enough just standing around. Go to the armory, choose your gear, and meet me back at the wagon. 15 minutes, anyone who can't get geared up in that time shouldn't be around." Ulrich dramatically turned around and left the recruits to their devices.

All recruits turned and walked down the corridor towards the armory, some murmuring started as the complete freshmen asked the people with family in the guild what's going on, but no one could answer. Killian himself knew that this was a new procedure. Not that his father or brother had ever explained the steps of the selection process, but the brother said that the process changed after their father had failed to return from his last incursion, and often grumbled about the new step.

Lost in thought of what could cause the brother to be so upset, Killian mechanically picked the first set of chainmail his hand fell into. The belts, gauntlets and hammers, all resembling the artifacts in the museum, were hanging on a wall. Killian's gaze was locked into one set of gauntlets, that seemed older than any other, the lightning burn motif looking like it could almost pierce the whole gauntlet. Without thought, he started towards the gauntlet rack, but before he made it halfway there, a hand picked them up. It belonged to another recruit, a tall man with a broken nose that healed in the wrong position and serious, caramel coloured eyes.

Killian shook his head, reached for a newer pair that seemed like it could accompany his whole career in the guild. Still groggy, he also picked a belt and tabard, and almost in slow motion finished dressing up. Finally, he went for the hammers when he noticed there was none left. All other recruits held their 2 handed weapons behind them, avoiding Killian's gaze. Only the voice of Yorin rang out "Let's see if you're more than just your name" and laughed. Determined to not be thrown out before even entering the guild, Killian just shoved past the loud mouth and towards the entrance, where a row of elephants tied to carriages was waiting behind Ulrich.

"Now children!" his shouts were somewhere between an angry general barking orders and the mocking concerned tour guide from when Killian first visited the guild, "I will explain the assignment, and then you will have one last chance to back out. I don't want anyone dying, you hear me?" Every recruit nodded. "Good. Now, 6 years ago, we had an important mission go wrong. A team was sent to investigate suspicious giant activity beyond our borders, and only one person returned. The real tragedy, however" Ulrich stopped looking at Killian at this moment, "was the equipment we lost in that trip. You are to go out in pairs and try to..."

"ARE YOU INSANE?" Cried the usually mocking voice of Yorin, this time with real terror behind it. "We have no training, no real backup, and you want to send us to giant country where trained soldiers DIED?"

"It's ok, son, you don't have to go." Ulrich replied instantly, "leave your things in the armory, and sign the discharge papers." Yorin started to protest but the general swiftly said "If anyone else is having memory issues and can't remember the rest of the selection process where you were expected to learn the spells and tactics we use, I suggest you follow in that brave man's footsteps. There is no shame in admitting when you're in over your head" the lie was obvious in this last sentence. "No one? Good. As I was saying, you are to go out in pairs and search for any information you can. There will be an examiner with you, but their job will be about taking notes, not babysitting you. Now, when I call your name, step forward and follow the examiner into the wagon." Ulrich pulled out a list and started calling recruits.

Once more, Killian didn't pay much mind to the names of the recruits. Most of them wouldn't make it anyway, he had a better use for his energy. "And finally," Ulrich put down his list, and looked forward, "Killian and Roy. I'll be your examiner this time." For once, Killian was glad to be called last, as he would have a chance to talk to the general about a weapon.

"Sir?" Killian apprehensively approached the man who had already instantly dismissed someone else for speaking up, "May I ask to take Yorin's weapon, srir? There weren't enough in the armory, and I believe I will be more useful with a weapon, sir."

"You had 15 minutes to gear up. Those minutes are up. I suggest fighting harder for a weapon next time. Are you going to wait for next year to try again?" Ulrich seemed almost happy at the chance to deny someone else. "No, sir!" "Well, then don't get yourself killed."

The ride was slow and tense. Some time after the wagon left the city, the first pair of recruits left, then the second, and so on. Once the wagon was empty save for the last pair, Ulrich softened his demeanor and admitted to Kilian "For what its worth, I'm sorry, kid." Roy gave a confused look at both of them, "I was there in your father's last mission. I just have to play the part, you understand?" a slight nod from Killian encouraged the confession further, "I am sure one day I will be able to tell you the full story of what happened, but until then, all I can say is I'm sorry"

With these last words, the wagon stopped at what seemed to be the end of the road, the clearing had a loop big enough for the wagon to spin around and move back to safety. As soon as he stepped in the ground, Killian felt the same weird feeling that he felt earlier today, and almost by themselves, his feet started towards the wall of trees opposite to the city. Very faintly, the boy heard Ulrich mumbling something through a haze. A weight fell on his shoulder, and as if still half asleep he turned to see Ulrich holding him and his voice finally came into focus "...tincts are good, but you shouldn't head straight to the heart of giant country. We want answers, but more importantly, we want the recruits to survive and help future searches."

"Respectfully, sir" Killian fought an internal battle - deciding whether he should just say what he felt or if he should try to use logic first. He decided on the latter, "it has been 6 years. If the safe searches were going to find an answer, they'd have done so already."

"You think we haven't gone that way yet? I got lost countless times in this forest already."

"I just have this feeling" Killian continued, dropping all pretenses of a logical explanation. "I feel like the answer is right here, just out of my reach." The boy observed his hand his hand gesticulate grasping at something, instead of pointing, and his fingers started to tingle. The color faltered on Ulrich's face.

"I am not here to stop death wishes. If you are really that keen, go ahead, throw yourself at the forest. Roy", Ulrich turned back to the other recruit who was staying a couple of steps behind, "I suggest you take my advice and start your search on the area where you can still see the sky behind the canopy"

"Sir, I hear you, sir." Roy's face betrayed his anxiety at this answer, "But I think I should stick to Killian, sir. We have a better chance of survival if we stick together, sir." Ulrich, just shook his and stepped back, signalling he'd wash his hands of any guilt. "I hope you have a plan", Killian turned to face the trees again, trying to figure out where that feeling was coming from, and started to brave the forest once more.

Roy had a hard time keeping up with Killian. Not because the latter was running, but instead because the former actually wanted to pass the test, so every so often he stopped to look for tracks. After some 20 minutes following the invisible trail that seemed to have hypnotized Killian, Roy started noticing it too. It started simply as harder dirt, but the further they went, the more apparent it looked, with a larger space, clearly cut trees until he actually stumbled onto Killian.

The hypnotized man had stopped at what seemed a humongous road, perpendicular to the  direction they were going. When Roy followed his partner's eyes, however, he noticed the real reason they stopped. Across the road from them, just as stunned, sat a bald man, with a hammer by his side, only he looked too tall to be a regular man. All at once, the enemy leapt from the chair, reaching for his hammer, and Roy pulled his own, shouted "Giant!" and moved away from the still paralyzed Killian, who had his eyes fixed on the enemy weapon.

The enemy jumped at him, and Killian's reflexes finally kicked in, stepping aside the hammer that was aimed at nailing him to the ground. He felt the familiar tingling of lightning in his hands as he attempted to retaliate with a shocking punch, but the giant was nimbler than expected, giving no breathing room, sweeping the hammer towards the man's head. It was barely stopped by the arcane shield incantation, and the surprise in the giant's face was enough for Killian to perform the thunder sigil with his left hand and punch the hammer away from the giant's hand, with a ear-shattering rumble, the official signal of trouble in this test.

Killian heard Roy give a battle cry, but luckily the creature itself was covering their ears, so it's only warning was the war hammer attempting to shatter its leg. Killian stumbled away at the yell of pain, as the giant turned on the spot. Sergei's words rung louder than the brain fog of the whole trip: "your life will depend on this hammer one day. Be sure to always have it at arms reach". The tingling became almost unbearable, as he reached out to the fallen hammer. Streaks of blue formed at his shoulder, and following his arm, coalesced in his grasp at the shape of the hammer. Without thinking , Killian exclaimed "o√£vorT" and remade the thunder sigil, sending an even stronger shockwave. Both Roy and the giant flew away at the sheer strength of the impact.

Even Ulrich, who was a good few feet away still, stumbled as he yelled for Killian to use the cover spell. His hands were trembling as he made a cloud sigil and said "aov√©N". A fog enveloped the area, as Ulrich yelled "Run back to the road, I'll meet you there". With the brain fog finally cleared, Killian set off faster than he ever did. A final thunderous sound came from behind him, and as he ran he saw in front of him Ulrich carrying an unconscious Roy. Killian slowed down so Ulrich could keep up and offered to carry the colleague, but the examiner denied.

"Is the giant dead?" Killian asked, hoping to be able to slow down and maybe give Roy an easier time.

"Giant? Hahahaha" Ulrich laughed in reply. "Oh Killian, that was no giant, that was just an Ogrillon. Nowhere near as big - or bad - as a giant. If you had seen a real one, I'd have stepped in much sooner." Ulrich gave a serious look back to Killian, "and no, it hasn't died. You did hurt it a bit, though, I think he's going to be quite confused and we are probably fine. For now."

"You know", Ulrich said slowing down to a light jog, "thunder clapping is normally a sign that you're quitting the challenge, because you can't take care of yourself" Killian lowered his head and sighed. "I guess you were lucky, then, to have found the Hammer of Thunderbolts that your dad lost 6 years ago."

"WHAT?" Killian couldn't remain respectful in this situation.

"Did you really think we left the most powerful artifacts for killing giants gathering dust, and only used them to show kids once a year?" Ulrich laughed. "That wouldn't be very smart, now would it?"

"Why are you telling me this? And why do you let people just take it around? It would get lost all the time, wouldn't it?" Killian attempted to continue asking questions, but Ulrich stopped him.

"Because", you could hear a slight exhaustion from running for so long, "whoever is called by one of the artifacts will always be part of the guild. We were hoping that one of these days a recruit would find it, but that isn't the only way to enter." Killian was lost in thought for some time. Only when they made it back to the clearing did Ulrich continue the conversation, "Oh, yeah, and I think this means you're in my squad. Relic users are supposed to always stay together." Ulrich smiled tapping his belt, then glanced at Roy's gauntlets. "That's how we ensure they don't get lost." the smile faded "that means I failed as much as your father, that day."

Hours later, back in his office, Ulrich looked at the official letter from the King's royal advisor. It read: "To whom it may concern, we, the royal court, formally request that all adventurers within your rank present themselves to the king's court at your earliest convenience. We have reason to believe that, although a force for good, such powerful people may not be left to their own devices, lest the populace be left to deal with the consequences." Ulrich sighed. "Just as I thought that I was finally going to get somewhere."
